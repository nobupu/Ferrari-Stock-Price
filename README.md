"Purpose of this Project"

 The purpose of this project is to see if the Ferrari(RACE)'s stock price in NYSE is influenced by the race result of its own Formula-1(F1) team or not.

As the influence of the F1 race result, Negative & Positive Score(PN Score) of twitter’s comments for Ferrari F1 team account(Scuderia Ferrari) is used.

The PN scores which are used in this project cover the days of all races in 2018 season except for the race in March because of my Twitter’s api plan.

The coverage period of the stock price change  is from 2018-01-02 to 2019-02-26.

How can you expect the result of this project ? 

Do you think the stock price is influenced by the race result of F1 or not ?
